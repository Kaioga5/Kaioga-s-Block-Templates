# Block Templates Details - 1.20.80

This document provides details about each block template in the 1.20.80 module, including features, missing features, and compatibility.

# When will we see more templates?

The templates are updated to use the Beta-API experimental toggle, and more will be added in the near future. Please remember that the Scripting API is not my expertise, and templates may take longer to update. Im learning a new language mainly to update this repository with the pass of time.
